# Ray Tracing in Kerr Spacetime

This code calculates the trajectory of light (ray - geometrical optics) on a background Kerr spacetime.

The code solves a set of ODEs numerically. We use a Hamiltonian formulation as described in [Pu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02063). Going beyond the usual vacuum approach, we also consider the influence of plasma on the ray spacetime trajectory. See [Kimpson et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.2411K/abstract).
